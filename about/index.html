        <p>Hello. I go by the name Riyst. I am learning to code and become a dev.
            This is my first website attempt so its not very good but will be evolving overtime.
            I am learning how to code but will get better overtime

            I never took IT class. It never appealed to me untill it was too late and i couldn't change subjects.
            Evrything i do on computers is self taught. I use youtube videos or have the support from my friends
            who are computer geniuses. My firt ever project was making this website,
            pretty basic right? overtime i will be adding bits into it to form a website i will be happy with.
            Eventualy i will be making small projects and uploading them on my Github page.
        </p>

            I am passionate in the things i love, and that is the legal sector and computing such as coding.
            Idealy i want a job that can link both of these jobs together. I want to become a advanced coder
            who can pass on knowledge to other people.
